To set up the log_DIR in the oracle for log file creations we need the directory to be created for the purpose of pl/sql logs, if this is not already exists.
In the sqlplus session, perform the following steps for the user, ‘venu’
step 1: connect sys/summer2015
step 2: create directory LOG_DIR='c:\plsql\logs';
step 3: grant privileges to venu
         EX: GRANT EXECUTE ON UTL_FILE to <<SCHEMA_NAME>>(Your schema).
             GRANT READ ON DIRECTORY user_dir TO PUBLIC;
             GRANT READ ON DIRECTORY user_dir TO DBA;
